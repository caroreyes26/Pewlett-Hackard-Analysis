# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Project Overview 
The purpose of the analysis is to determine how many employees will be retiring in the upcoming years. We look at different data sets that provide information such as titles, tenure, salaries, and departments. By looking at the data and creating new data sets, managers are able to determine how many employees are retiring in the near future. They can also look at how many per department which is helpful to prepare and hire new employees. It also helps determine who is eligible for the mentorship program. 

## Results
Based on the results from the analysis:
- 1,549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program. 
- The majority of employees retiring soon are Software Engineers. 
- Employees with a Senior Staff title are the most eligible for the mentorship program. 
- This is very helpful information as it can help managers start a plan for the backfills. 

## Challenge Summary 
Based on the results:
- There are 90,398 employees that will need to be filled with the "silver tsunami".
- There's only 1,549 employees that are qualified to mentor the new employees. There are not enough retiring employees to backfill the next generations of Pewlett Hackard employees.
